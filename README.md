How to install this site:
====================================
Install virtualenv on your machine and use it to maintain the site.
The following are couple of commands for operating under virtual env:

	#Install python virtualenv
	$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
	
	#Create a virtual environment directory
	$ virtualenv /path/to/virtualenv_dir
	
	#Activating virtual environment(while you're in virtualenv_dir)
	$ source bin/activate
	
	#Deactivating virtual env
	$ deactivate

After creating and activating virtualenv, while inside virtualenv folder,
clone this site's source codes:
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/chingalo/reportissues.git
	or
	$ git clone https://chingalo@bitbucket.org/chingalo/reportissues.git

Inside reportissues directory, install project dependencies inside: requirements.txt
	
	$ cd reportissues
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
Add database  configurations inside reportissues/settings.py, your
database configurations should look something similar to this if you are using MySQL:
	
	DATABASES = {
    'default': { 
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', 
        'NAME': 'DATABASE NAME',                     
        'USER': 'USER NAME',
        'PASSWORD': 'PASSWORD',
    }
}
After configuration sync database( run command: python manage.py syncdb) and then run the server( run command: python manage.py runserver ).
Incase of any difficulties in configuration refer to [Django CMS Documentation](http://django-cms.readthedocs.org/en/2.2/getting_started/installation.html)
for more information.
